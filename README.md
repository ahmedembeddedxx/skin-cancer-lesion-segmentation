# Skin Lesion Detection using Dual Modalities of Image and Vector

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning and deep learning techniques for the detection of skin cancer using 3D Total Body Photography (TBP). The project leverages multiple data modalities and architectures to enhance the detection accuracy and robustness.

## Overview

Skin cancer detection is a critical area in medical research. This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate detection system using state-of-the-art techniques. The implemented models include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and a variety of machine learning algorithms such as Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Random Forest (RF), Balanced Random Forest (BRF), and CatBoost.

## Architectures and Modalities

Four different modalities were used for development, each implemented in separate Jupyter notebooks. Below are the architectural images corresponding to each modality:
